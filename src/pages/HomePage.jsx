            <hr />
            <p>My name is Nicholas, and I'm an aspiring Full Stack Developer from Nashville, TN.
            <br />
            I'm a results-oriented Supply Chain professional with extensive experience in Aerospace, Merchandise, and Beverage industries, possessing a diverse skillset encompassing logistics, transportation, and operations management alongside newly acquired Full Stack Web Development proficiency. With a Bachelor of Science in Liberal Studies and completion of a Full Stack Web Development program, I bring a blend of frontend and backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React.js, Node.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. My background ranges from procurement and supply chain initiatives where I led projects resulting in significant cost reductions to roles as a professional driver at Ruan and PepsiCo where I streamlined operations. Now seeking to apply my strategic mindset, analytical skills, and commitment to innovation to the field of Full Stack Web Development, I am poised to contribute to dynamic teams and drive impactful digital solutions.
